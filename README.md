# LAZY BOX

A Docker Box for my personal development environment and CTF competitions

## Install

Needs docker and python3 installed, then run `lazy.py`, it will pull the image, create a container and start it up.

Default bindings to directory are `C:\Users\${USER}` and `D:\` to `/root/Computer/User` and `/root/Computer/Data`.
